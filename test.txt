    "content": "### Explanation of error\nThe error occurred because there is a missing closing parenthesis in the line `sum = (5 + 10 * 2`. This causes a syntax error because Python expects a closing parenthesis to complete the expression.\n\n### Potential modification\nTo fix the syntax error, you should add a closing parenthesis to the end of the line `sum = (5 + 10 * 2)`. This will complete the expression and allow the code to run without errors. \n\nAdditionally, there are other errors in the code:\n- In the first line, the variable name is `message` but it is referred to as `msg` in the second line. To fix this, you should change `msg` to `message`.\n- In the third line, `add()` is not a valid method for lists in Python. To add an element to a list, you should use the `append()` method. So, you should change `numbers.add(6)` to `numbers.append(6)`.\n- In the last line, you are trying to concatenate a string and an integer. To fix this, you should convert the integer to a string using the `str()` function. So, you should change `print(\"I am \" + age + \" years old.\")` to `print(\"I am \" + str(age) + \" years old.\")`.",
